PART 1

1.) Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species). Explain how and why you came to this conclusion.

I regonized 6 different species. With differences between size, the presence of ridges (verses being smooth), the strata placement, and the D, WD, and UD measurments.

Species A: Specimens 1, 8, 11
  These specimens are all larger and all had defined ridges along with similar measurements for the D and UD measurements along with being located in the same strata.
  
Species B: Specimens 2, 6, 12, 18
  These specimens are some of the smallest with mild beveled ridges. They span in two different strata but have similarites with their WD measurements and all have consistant D measurements.
  
Species C: Specimens 3, 7, 15, 17
  These specimens are also on the smaller side but with little to no ridges. They have larger D and WD measurements than species B and are located across many strata.
  
Species D: Specimens 4, 10, 20, 21
  These specimens are medium sized with half having more pronounced ridges than the other half. They all have the same WD measurements and are located very near each other in the strata.
  
Species E: Specimens 5, 14, 23, 24
  These specimens are small and smooth. They have a larger WD measurements and are in older strata. Half have very small UD measurements compared to the other half and they all have similar D measurements. 
  
Species F: Speciments 9, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25
  These specimens had little to no ridge detail. They're medium to large in size and are strewn across different strata. They also all have similar WD measurements. 

2.) The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative or quantitative traits you think are important.

The morphological features included shell characteristics of the presence of ridges, the size of the shell, and the D, WD, and UD measurements. Strata was also considered but not as integral as the other characteristics.

3.) The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species. Explain your reasoning.

Some species had different sizes but similar characteristics otherwise. Since younger organisms generally represent a smaller version of the adult forms, this would explain why there would be these size differences. Many animals have slight ratio differences from juvinile to adult forms and this can be seen in species E and F.

4.) The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility.

Sexual dimorphism is typically seen when half of a specimen set of species is different than the other half but both retain very similar characteristics, this can take the form of size or exaggerated characteristics. Different thickness, or W measurements, could represent sexual dimorphism along with ridge presence. In this data set, the presence of more defined ridge detail on half the set and more smoothness on the other half (see  species D). Size difference in half the set can also represent sexual dimorphism since males are typically larger than females (see species E).

PART 2, SECTION 1

1.) Each element of the plethodon list has a name. What are they?

The five elements of the plethodon list are land, links, species, site, and outline. 

2.) What class is each object?

The class for land, links, and outline is double. The class for species and site is factor.

3.) Whare are the dimensions of the first object in the plethodon list?

The dimensions of the first object in the plethodon list, land, is located after the type (double) and is 12x2xx40.

PART 2, SECTION 2

1.) Use the hummingbird dataset. Which object in the list records the landmark data?

The first object in the list records the landmark data.

2.) Perform a procrustes on the landmark data.
3.) Perform a PCA on the hummingbird data.
4.) How many "species" of hummingbird are there?

There are 42 "species". 

PART 3

1.) What is the synapomorphy of the clade containing species D and E?

Fangs longer than 6 inches are the synapomorphy of the clade containing D and E.

2.) What is a plesiomorphic character of that clade?

Sulfurous odor is the plesiomorphic character of the clade containing D and E.

3.) What is the synapomorphy of the clade containing species A and B?

Adorable eyelashes is the synapomorphy of the clade containing A and B.

4.) Which taxa have a sulfurous odor?

The taxa of species C, D, and E have a sulfurous odor.

5.) What character distinguishes species D from species E?

The laser death ray characteristic distinguishes D from E.

6.) Are adorable eyelashes a synapomorphy or an autapomorphy?

Adorable eyelashes are a synapomorphy because it contains more than one species.

7.) Traditionally, the five taxa are grouped into three families. Determine if each family is monophyletic, paraphyletic, or polyphyletic.

Families 1 and 3 are monophyletic and family 2 is polyphyletic.

8.) More recently, species A has been grouped in a family with species D and E. Is this advisable? Why or why not?

This isn't advisable because there are no given traits that species A share with species D and E. They are also very distinct on the phylogenic tree. 

9.) Determine if the following groups are monophyletic, paraphyletic, or polyphyletic.

Groups 1 and 5 are polyphyletic, groups 2 and 4 are monophyletic, and group 3 is paraphyletic.
