PART 1

1.) Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species). Explain how and why you came to this conclusion.

I regonized 6 different species. With differences between size, the presence of ridges (verses being smooth), the strata placement, and the D, WD, and UD measurments.

Species A: Specimens 1, 8, 11
  These specimens are all larger and all had defined ridges along with similar measurements for the D and UD measurements along with being located in the same strata.
  
Species B: Specimens 2, 6, 12, 18
  These specimens are some of the smallest with mild beveled ridges. They span in two different strata but have similarites with their WD measurements and all have consistant D measurements.
  
Species C: Specimens 3, 7, 15, 17
  These specimens are also on the smaller side but with little to no ridges. They have larger D and WD measurements than species B and are located across many strata.
  
Species D: Specimens 4, 10, 20, 21
  These specimens are medium sized with half having more pronounced ridges than the other half. They all have the same WD measurements and are located very near each other in the strata.
  
Species E: Specimens 5, 14, 23, 24
  These specimens are small and smooth. They have a larger WD measurements and are in older strata. Half have very small UD measurements compared to the other half and they all have similar D measurements. 
  
Species F: Speciments 9, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25
  These specimens had little to no ridge detail. They're medium to large in size and are strewn across different strata. They also all have similar WD measurements. 

2.) The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative or quantitative traits you think are important.

The morphological features included shell characteristics of the presence of ridges, the size of the shell, and the D, WD, and UD measurements. Strata was also considered but not as integral as the other characteristics.

3.) The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species. Explain your reasoning.

Some species had different sizes but similar characteristics otherwise. Since younger organisms generally represent a smaller version of the adult forms, this would explain why there would be these size differences. Many animals have slight ratio differences from juvinile to adult forms and this can be seen in species E and F.

4.) The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility.

Sexual dimorphism is typically seen when half of a specimen set of species is different than the other half but both retain very similar characteristics, this can take the form of size or exaggerated characteristics. Different thickness, or W measurements, could represent sexual dimorphism along with ridge presence. In this data set, the presence of more defined ridge detail on half the set and more smoothness on the other half (see  species D). Size difference in half the set can also represent sexual dimorphism since males are typically larger than females (see species E).
