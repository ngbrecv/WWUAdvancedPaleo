The first GPA plot below shows all the different data points that were gathered from the 29 fish diagrams. The darker points are the averages of each of the 13 landmarks. The plot is also rotated from the origional pictures by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Now the first PCA plot below shows the variance between the diagrams in a more collective sense. Dots closer together resemble diagrams that are more closely related while ones further represent more extreme values.
